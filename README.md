## 🧮 Arithmetic Unit (AU)

- Uses only one 16-bit full adder, with inputs selected via a 4-to-1 multiplexer.
- Efficient reuse of adder for all 4 arithmetic operations.

---

## 🔣 Logic Unit (LU)

- Uses standard bitwise gates for AND, OR, NAND, XOR.
- Output based on lower 2 bits of the opcode.

---

## 🧩 ALU Integration

- A 2-to-1 multiplexer selects between AU and LU output depending on `Opcode[2]`.
- Simulation done in **Quartus** with waveform output verification.

## 🧮 Additional Exercise – 4-bit Unsigned Multiplier

### 🔢 Description

- Multiplies a 4-bit input by the last digit of the student ID (6).
- Result is stored in an 8-bit output.
- Built using:
- Partial product generation
- Bit shifting
- 1-bit full adders (total: 12 used)

### 🧪 Simulation
